# E Bus Pass

E Bus Pass is an innovative electronic bus pass system designed to simplify and enhance public transportation experiences. This project utilizes RFID technology and GPS tracking to provide a seamless and efficient way for passengers to manage their bus tickets and track bus locations in real-time.

### Features

- **RFID-Based Ticketing**: Passengers use RFID cards to board buses. The RFID reader scans the card to validate and deduct the fare automatically.
- **Online Recharge**: Passengers can recharge their RFID cards through a dedicated website. Secure login ensures that only authorized users can manage their card balances.
- **Live Bus Location Tracking**: The bus's live location is updated on the website using a GPS module integrated into the ticket machine. Passengers can track the bus in real-time, ensuring better planning and reduced waiting times.

### Components

- **RFID Reader and Cards**: For easy and quick ticket scanning.
- **Website**: For user login, card recharge, and live bus tracking.
- **GPS Module**: For real-time location updates of the bus.
- **Ticket Machine**: Integrated with RFID reader and GPS module.

### How It Works

1. **RFID Ticketing**: Passengers tap their RFID cards on the reader when boarding the bus. The system verifies the card and deducts the appropriate fare.
2. **Online Recharge**: Users log in to the website using their credentials to recharge their RFID cards. The website provides a secure and user-friendly interface for managing balances.
3. **Live Tracking**: The GPS module in the ticket machine continuously updates the bus's location on the website, allowing passengers to see the real-time location of the bus.

### Benefits
